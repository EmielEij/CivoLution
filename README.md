# Civolution a 2d strategy game

Hi, and welcome to my attempt at making a 2D strategy game!
The general concept is to create a 2D map-based game in C++, where you can build cities to gather resources and use those resources to expand your cities.

At the start, your cities will have a population of artisans and workers who are not very productive. However, as your population gains more resources, they will specialize into different roles and become more efficient. But they will also become more dependent on the resources produced by other specialized populations.

## progress / ideas

- [X] Set up a C++ project that can display a map.
- [X] Implement terrain generation.
- [X] Split up the code into different classes.
- [X] Create a display class to visualize the map for tweaking.
- [X] Adjust generation settings to create a well-balanced map.
- [X] Create a menu type to select a map.
- [ ] Add rivers.
- [ ] Add resources to the map.
- [ ] Implement player map interactions (scrolling, zooming, clicking, etc.).
- [ ] Implement cities.
- [ ] Implement roads and river transportation (barges/boats).
- [ ] Implement farms, brick makers, lumberjacks, and luxury goods for the population.

After this, expand specializations, improve logistics, and progress toward some form of industrialization.prob mechanization (with wind mills and water power) into a full blown industrialization. (coal power heavy industry)

## how to run
